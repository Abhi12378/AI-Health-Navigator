# AI Health Navigator – Requirements

## 1. Problem Statement
People often struggle to understand health symptoms and decide the right next step—self-care, doctor consultation, or emergency care. This confusion leads to panic, delayed treatment, unnecessary hospital visits, and poor health outcomes. Existing solutions are fragmented and focus on diagnosis or fitness rather than decision support and care navigation.

## 2. Objective
To build a responsible AI-powered health navigation and decision-support system that helps the public understand symptoms, navigate healthcare options, and act appropriately—without replacing doctors or providing medical diagnosis.

## 3. Target Users
- General public
- Rural and semi-urban citizens
- Caregivers and families
- Healthcare systems (indirect benefit)

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Accept symptom and health-related queries in natural language
- Classify urgency into self-care, doctor visit, or emergency
- Provide educational health guidance based on public medical guidelines
- Offer care navigation (clinic, hospital, emergency services)
- Provide medication literacy (non-prescriptive)
- Support basic mental health guidance
- Emergency mode with SOS numbers and first-aid guidance
- Display clear ethical disclaimers

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- High availability and scalability
- Fast response time
- Secure communication
- Minimal or no personal data storage
- Easy-to-use and accessible UI

## 6. Constraints & Ethics

- Clear disclaimers stating informational support only

## 7. Success Metrics
